 Imagine that how cool it is to have the ability to take notes on your pictures not just a simple description and title about the picture but the ability to add description and details about a side of the image and see those things every time on your pic as you save it before without the problem of losing the original picture and crowding the photo with text or extra signs by putting an appropriate sign or color as you choose on the pic. My goal as a new on android developing is to Create an app for Adding description to pictures, not only a description about the picture but adding more description and details about every thing on Picture with a User Friendly Design that makes it different. My app is about to give the user an editor that open the image( at least JPG ) and the ability to choose a part of Picture and adding the note ( text , audio even another image ) as the detail. Another feature of my app is that the user has a good image viewer app that can view the image on device easily with these power to opening existed details on any pictures and easily see the detail by a finger movement . And my wish is to extend the app in the future with the power that can add information on different type of text( pdf, docs , ... ) or pictures with this specific use . Simple but more Useful I hope Thanks
